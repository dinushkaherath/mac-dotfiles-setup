He who believes has eternal life. If one performs good works after he believes, he will, in addition to having eternal life, receive a reward.
"Repay each man according to his doings" (Matt. 16:27)
"Receive the inheritance as recompense" (Col. 3:22-24)
"My reward is with Me to render to each one as his work is" (Rev. 22:12)
Works that are without faith:
Fleshly and worldly
Of the self
Inward and downward
Leading to darkness and hardship
According to man's wavering condition
Faith:
Of God and of heaven
Based on Christ's accomplished work
Outward and upward
Leading to light and peace
According to God's unchanging truth
