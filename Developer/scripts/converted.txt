repentance, bg immersed into e 3g, x, e Body. all o ese take some exe. “But uv nd o solid food.” These r referred t as w o rsn. it includes, “It is vain t say ta u ej e l but not bear fruit.” Similar t John, “You say…but u walk in dkn.” The vine se incn oe 3g w/ m skg t grow until e earth is fld w/ e gl o g. “When we open any page oe bb, we sd read w/ a skg hrt n pr, ‘Lord I lv You so I come t Your w. b my drink n b my food.’” We all miss this—we can talk au e w, talk au wtg, e gifts n all e members—if we don’t ve skg hrt ox, if x int e obj o qr skg. cng e gifted mbs he refers t himself but not jt himself. e ch has e elders, e leading ones, who r mig e w t e sas, who r e gifted mbs, who va partq su. we all va partq su as we get into e w n ta w come out o us, it comes out in a partq way. peter was df than John. paul was df frm Peter n John. so wnt b ie w. “In e mtgs oe ch wr always dealing w/ e bb.” You va phrase ta has bc often meaningless, not always, “So we see…” And en u spk wa we c. but u don’t show us wa we c. cng e bride ox, e Body bg e bride, Br. lee went tr several steps w/ vvs. we ve mtr o Adam n Eve, dth n sleep. sleep is rly wa dth is. in ta dth ere was no blood bec ere was no sin. but x shed his blood bec ere was e sin ta had t b dealt w/. u c e dfc? so wvt b ie w in details ae miy presents n lrn t present wa e miy has presented. ii easy, or spu, t present wa was in another class or conf. but wnt exe t get into ti w f ti class, not bec iia class but bec ti is food. n wnt lrn how t dp ti food into others. “Saints can go…speaking w/ all e bb vvs.” We get wtd (whether or not we understand). but we ourselves sd not ve aspiration jt t b wtd. e wtg is needed—encouragement, flowing. but wnt get into e w. ow we wl nvr b a su. we wl nvr wt others. ey get wtd bec we spk w/ e bb. he is setting himself as qr ex. “I do not v much kl in fields other than e bb, but by e lz mercy, I somewhat know ti hl book. i can open ti book n wt e sas.” You can wt e sas jt by flaying au. u lrn by flaying…“The pattern oe healthy w,” I think it was Darby ta translated e [outline]. “My spkg ie miy o gz w se sprinkling.”…God’s eco. “We nd t come t e mtgs oe ch n oe miy t take a “shower” or a “bath” ie wt oew.” So here u r, rcg. but when u present, prfs, spk e gp, share w/ smo, u sd b mig. u sd b giving em st solid oew, order oew, cutting straight so ta ey can rc st. “The gifted ones may do e planting n e wtg, but ii g who gives e growth in lf. ti is y I must always take some time t pr b4 I come t spk in a meeting…We nd e fdg frm e bb directly, n we nd e wtg frm e ones who know e bb more. god goes along w/ qr readg oe Word n w/ e spkg oe gifted mbs {to spk e word}. e fdg n e wtg r e top means used by hm t qv hs lf t us.” Then he brings us t e highest peak oe growth oe ch bec ii g growing. ere is mention o, “We nd t qv hm room.” How do we qv hm room? by readg e bb. u might think we qv hm room by, “Oh, I qv room t You, im all t You.” But we search…but wouldn't come t Him…it is t fd hm directly. “We may b full oe world, o ourselves, o qr own interests, but by readg e bb, lbl e w oe bb takes away some part o qr worldliness, some part o qr self-interest, n some part o qr lv f tgs other than g hf. en w/n us more room is given t g. en h takes ti room n expands n increases w/n us. ti increase is hs growth in us. his growth bcs qr growth bec we n h r 1/.” That is how he introduces e mtr o maturity. ti se high peak, highest peak ie church’s growth. john 6. 1/a e l says h se bread ta came down frm hv. we can eat hm n live. some p did eat hm. peter said, “To whom shall we go?

his name meant fool. “Rivalry int only a sign o ambition but pride…thinking more highly o yourself…is another form o pride.” It is gd tva model n cf ourselves t ta model. wrnt only gz creatures n gz ss (in e old n new creations), but wr slaves. as slaves, we don’t even come t e status o bg a creature, nvr mind e son. if we can remember ourselves ie status o a slave, we can b svd frm e pride. a slave ie modern thinking is vy df frm e slave ie bba thinking. ie bba thinking, a slave serves out o lv. 1/a o all, out o qr Master, x, en f e lv f qr heart’s delight, e ch, hs Body, n f e ctts o hs Body, all e children, all e mbs. if we lv qr Master, e ch, e sas, w/ hs interest in view, en we wlb wlg t sacrifice, we wlb wlg t suffer loss. n if we suffer loss, en ta is lv. lv int a feeling. ii qr sacrifice o lv ta is qr lv. in sacrificing we humble ourselves, we serve others. so x in hs hy humbled hf t was hs disciple’s feet. ti ia model f us. so when we enter ta model, e lf in us fits ta pattern n we can xp serving others in lv. en ere is no pride. ere is simple, wr slave. wr invisible, wr nothing. wrnt a hero wearing a mask, we know better. don’t u know better than ta u r st? o course wv ti tg in us called pride, arguing who is greater is an ugly form o pride… “Wanting t b great n not t b a servant, n wanting t b 1/a n not t b a slave is also a sign o pride.” We used tva newsletter among e chs, news oe chs. but vl e flavors, e elders exalting eir wk, eir ch, wa is happening ere, wa ey r doing; n ti kind o tg caused e news oe chs t b abandoned, no more. an ugly form o pride. “Lording it over e ch,” n f u, over ose under ur care…that is, telling em wa t do. doesn’t mtr how young ey r. ey may know e l better than u do. ey certainly know e l. ey know t ab ie l. we can help em in ta. “The apl Paul’s model, he preached himself ae lz n e believers’ slave f Jesus’s sake…he didn’t portray himself as stronger than others so ta he might gain e weak. t restore a brother who is taken in ofn w/ meekness, gentle…humility.” Protects us frm bg tempted also. if qr view is, “You r weaker than me n im going t restore u,” ta is evil is in us. ti is gag 6:1. “Self-boasting, -exalting, -glorification, n lusting after vainglory r all ugly n base epn o pride.” So, if we know e l in hs eco, qr rvn is fresh, e th is living, shining, growing in us, en we can know ourselves. when we know ourselves, en we can ask e l t b adjusted, rnd in qr mind, t take e onm as qr pattern, as qr living, 1/ Body, 1/ wk, 1/ hrt, 1/ mind, 1/ ds, 1/ prp. so in his prr, at e beginning o ti chapter, he asked e l, “deeply wk in us so ta we may coo w/ You t go tog wi You.” Pride confiscates qr ufn. pride can grow. it may take 20 yrs or 30. but by en it bcs a hero. a thought consuming us ta “we know e way, we know wa is better, wr e msgr oe better way, we can tch others.” Then he says, “We hide ourselves in You, n hide ourselves under e czg o Your precious blood, e prevailing blood wch protects us aga all e enemy’s devices. lord, rebuke him as You did b4 Joshua. although wr in such a base state, we still trust in Your mercy Lord…” Then he refers t Zechariah n t e l who pud, czd ones standing in filthy robe. f us tva pride, living a lf o hypocrisy, thinking we know, even as some o u said in ur presentation, urnt 40 yet but u r already thinking u r 80. isn’t ti a strange tg? ti is wa wr in ourselves. n he introduces e 3/ names in Zechariah 1, “At an appointed time, J wl bs, J wl remember.” Remember wa? bs wa? y did he say ta? bec e l has a move on e earth. he nds ose who r young, middle aged, n older, who r fresh, living, flexible, full o lf, able t b w/ ona w/o any rank, w/o any dominance, w/o any high pas in qr mind. ow ere can’t b 1/ Body, 1/ wk. heb. 3:2—‘Revive Your wk.’ This is rcvy. i am leper, im all over w/ leprosy. ta means wa I live out is far short ox. i don’t mean initiating x, but bg x, bg x epd, lived td on e earth. but, J wl bs at an appointed time. en Br. lee says, full o fe, “Lord, we bl ti se appointed time…we v absl no trust in ourselves.” Amen. so ti sd set us in qr drn in ti readg, wv ese diseases, ey r in us. td, e medical scientists wl tell us ta we ve bad bacterias living in us, viruses, even cancerous cells in us. but ey don’t necessarily vt take us over. so wv pride, ti drive t b sbo, t do st. remember, ose r e words ta r rptd in ti chapter: t b smo, t do st. pfg Training—our pb goes all e way back t e garden, eatg oe tree o kl o gd n evil bec we want t b smo, do st. ta has t b cut at e source. ta can happen but it has t happen at e lt oe rvn ox, o hs Body, e ch, o 1/ wk. all e rbns r inoculated aga in ti chapter. pride w/ its ambition, thinking ta wr a hero wearing a mask, bg hypocrites. woe tu hypocrites. blinded by pride t such an extent ta we think ta wr a hero, dmgg e Body. n old opid brothers, so sad, selling qr old wears. n en when we come t e wk in ti chapter, 1/a wvt c 1/ s, all e chs bg 1/, e prcs ie chs. n when we get t prc, we c not only e ch n e chs, e ch int divided in ess but 1/ wk. n ta wk int controlling e chs. er no chs o a wk. ere ia region o a wk. but chs rnt regionalized. n e apls rnt regionalized. i was also touched ie mention ie sharing cng ti mtr o giving. “Macedonia n Achaia…contribution t e poor in Jerusalem’ (Rom. 15:26). contribution ere is literally fp. can u go t India, t Pakistan, t all ese df pas all over e earth t fp?

Introduction:We v bn going over e book, Practical Points Concerning Blending, wch is composed o msgs given by Brother wle on May 27-30, 1994. e 1/a 3/ chapters present t us e prp, e nd, n e sgc oe blending. 1/a o all, we must rz ta e blending has absl t do w/ gee. qr g, who is living, moving, n acting has an ete eco t dp hf into m t pd an ogc Body t b hs ogm in lf f hs increase n epn. acc t ti eco, e 3g hf went tr a pc t bc a lgs t dp hf itus as lf. however, f e rbx, ere se nd f all e rgd cog t not remain as inds but b blended n built tog as 1/ ix. hc, e prp oe blending is t usher us all into e rbx. so td, wnt c qr dsp nd f blending. god int merely after many lc chs, but e rbx. eref, we must enter into e genuine blending among all e mbs. n actually ti se sgc oe blending, e rbx, wch is, as wlc, e highest peak in ge.4/16/2019PDengWow, [you] grew. i read ti booklet many times. i apd how e l wd qv qr brother such high rvn. 1/ time Br. lee was nld by e l n e l asked him...where se rbx? brother Ron once said he visited a pa w/ hundreds o chs but did not c any rbx. we all r ie ch lf, we all lv e l. even we qv ourselves t serve hm (practicing e God-ordained way). but wvt c wa se rbx. iint a kind o outward doing. ii st ta issue frm deep w/n. ii frm qrsp t qrsl n t qr daily living. so e corp gm living se rbx. br. lee used e w ‘perfected.’ What is t b pfd? ii t b mature. how can we b mature? e imp tg is t constantly put ourselves ie mold oe cs, denying ourselves, so ta e new lf, e nm, e lf ox can grow in us. n, furthermore, b lived out in us, in a corp way. en ere se rbx. i still remember how I was svd by 1/ older couple’s faces. i was 15. i was vy rbu t xny, t e l, I was aga xns basically. i even threw a bb t e grown in front o a xn. can u bl ta such p can b svd? 1/ day I was invited t a ho. e mmt I entered, I felt lt, a bright lt. i tried t find a bright decoration or lp. ere wasn’t. a min/ later, e parents o my classmate came t visit me. eir faces were shining. i said, ‘This se source oe lt.’ I’ve nvr seen a harmonious, joyful, lvg faces in front o me. n ey invited me t a xn mtg. ta was e 1/a time I attended e mtgs ie lz rcvy. i called upon e lz name ere f e 1/a time...I saw e rlt. on 1/ hand, during e 80s, I bl u read wa Br. lee said, ‘the rbx ses o rlt.’ Eph. 4—one Body, 1/ s. so e s se rbx. but in 1994, he said, ‘the corp living by e pfd gmn...’ If [there is] a pe who constantly live by e di lf, rejecting his naa lf, ere wlb a mfn. ta se gm living. ta wlb visible. on 1/ hand 90 percent oe ch takes care oe pha tgs. on e other hand we take care oes, lk ta couple who were shining. ere wlb e mfn. even I feel ta I saw e s on eir face. ta is eir lt. 1 Tim. 3—God is mfd ie fs. can g bn seen? can g b seen? yes! ow ere wlb no such a vv. e ch o g is g mfd ie fs if e ch has e rbx. e couple I saw who were so 1/ w/ ona, so harmonious, standing in front o me, bcm my svn, bcm a tty oe ch. ey r e rbx. but don’t think that—I don’t bl ta ey were lk ti right after ey were married. no, ey went tr a pc. instantly we can turn, we can deny ourselves. how? by calling on e lz name. i want t emphasize 2/ things: 1) How e l cd constantly deny hf n live by e Father’s lf? he constantly ejd e fa. he ejd e wg. e fa spks in hm. n h likewise spks. ere was a msg talking au eatg e butter n honey. how was e apl P able t live x? by e bss. even when h was ie prison h cd live x. ‘For me, t live is x.’ And even he cd mgf x. so when he lived ere, x, mgfd x ere, even his living ia gp, a svn t e other prisoners, t e jailers. so we cannot shine w/o x. ta is lk ti lp. nds electricity so ta e lp wl shine. amen? so evd wnt eat x. ev morning wnt ej richly ti x. do u think ti is vy simple? u heard it a hundred times. ti se number 1/ tg ta e enemy wants t attack. if u recall, during ur interim, wa se 1/a tg ta e enemy attack?

also ie pc, I guess. ii qr old mind, old emotion, even old wl, ta hinder e lz lf, e lz s in us t grow n t live. so ta is y we nd e wk oe cs. iint by qr own oppressing ourselves but by e wk oe cs. if wr open t hm, wlc ta actually e wk oe cs ops in us n ops ar us. jt ci ur roommates, teammates. on 1/ hand ey r bns vy lovable. but sometimes ey r jt lk a big cs, sinners. but do u know, ey r particularly arranged by e wl o g. in ur small gr, do u rz ere ia pa where u can rly xp e rbx by allowing e wk oe cs t deal w/u, not jt cause u t suffer but terminate ur om, ur fs, ur naa ctn. w/o e wk oe cs, ere is no way f u t ve rbx, even no way f u t ej e bx. jt ti vy tg, corp living. who likes corp living?

‘Because I wrote was too systematically clear.’ What does ta mean? if uva gd mind, a mind ta can go t universities, u can read it n und it. u wl say, ‘Right, now I c, m has 3/ parts…’ wne was vy clear, logical pe. but he said it was no gd bec u en don’t nd gz rvn t make it clear tu. y se bb not sysc?

‘How au now?’ ‘We rnt in a gd state. wr lacking e su.’ Br. lee, at ta time, saw e pl oe tree o lf. ‘Brothers, iint a mtr o right or wrong…for ur sake o bg ‘right,’ u kpt ti brother away. but u r in

‘We do not v anything t offer u except JX n hs gp.’ h was ere not only t preach e gp, gaining a big number, but mig x t em. e Body nds t v x dpd into em. how can uve bx except e dpg ox. en h saw ge.

I.	The aplt bg e entire spkg o g ie New Testament:	A.		B.		C.	 - So e aplt se entire spkg o g. now we sd dw on ti bec we don’t want t jt v terminology…that wv no idea wa it means. e aplt se spkg o g. so, ie gps, g is spkg ie S (Heb. 1:1-2). n aes, h is spkg ie apls. he is spkg but ie apls. finally, in Revelation, x is infd n is spkg tr John. so I nd t try t explain tu y we accept only e aplt. we ntk e dfc bw rcg all blrs n rcg all kinds o mis n tchgs. we can’t do ta. so let’s take a little journey. e l is on e earth. esp recorded in John. he says, “My tchg int Mine but ii hm who set Me. wa I hear, I spk. i spk e w ta e fa gave Me.” This se sog saying, “This int My tchg. i didn’t originate ti. ti is frm e fa. but I hear hm spkg, I spk.” Then in John 16, e l, anticipating hs rrn n tsfn into e lgs, h said, “The s o rlt wl come. he wl not spk frm hf. but h wl spk wa h has rcd frm Me.” So now e s, e 3g appd t us n reaching us is spkg, but h int saying, “Now ii My turn, I va clever idea. i va df feeling frm e S n e fa.” No, h is spkg wa e S spoke n e S spoke wa e fa spoke. 1 Cor. 2. in ti chapter, P says ta only e sp o m knows e tgs o g. only e tgs o g knows e tgs o g. n e s has rvd ese tgs t us, wch tg we spk, not in words o hu wm. but in words taught by e s. u c e pg? e fa se source. e tchg originates w/ hm. e S is here, spkg. god is spkg ie S. e S is spkg wa h rcd frm e fa. now, e s has come. e s is spkg wa h has rcd frm e S. now e apls r here n e apls r spkg wa ey rcd frm e s. n eir utterances is frm e s. eir words, eir utterances, iint hu wm, not naa eloquence, wittiness, brilliance. e w, e rvn, comes frm g, e s, n e words, is frm e instant aog. so we go frm e fa, t e S, tes, t e apls. so e aplt se tchg oef ie S n e S aes. so…the aplt se entire nt. so wa e apls emphasize we emphasize. wa ey mention n don’t emphasize we also ag n mention but don’t emphasize. hd covering is ere. but wrnt going to…that is contrary…This is y we follow e aplt. n wv confidence in Br. nee’s tchg n Br. lee’s tchg bec ie best o other undg, ey r fef t e aplt. we don’t isolate ese 2/ men n say ta we lk em n ey r tat. ta is drastically wrong. no, ey were dealt w/ by e l. dlnd. br. nee w/ his…photographic memory…sifted et, measured et by e scps. n en e l raised up Br. lee t match him. so ti is why—and Br. lee himself took e lead in ti direction—every tchg, spkg, must b born oe nt. we don’t follow blindly. br. nee said strongly himself t me, “Don’t follow me blindly.” But ae time goes by after e miy was transferred t Br. lee, n esp after Br. nee went t b w/ e l, surely e l developed e rvn in Br. lee, not st new but. n who r we t say ta ti wlt happen in pl until e l comes. ti is y ti epn e aplt, is so crucial. now, if smo tchs dfl, ci wa se source o ta. well, e source se only 1/ other source but 2/ lvls. i wd jt b e hu mind, e self. either, rather a smart pe or a vy sbjv pe, smo who has rcd false lt, ere is such a tg, mentioned in Isa. 50, p set fires f ems, ey think ti is generating a rl lf, but behind se enemy…so ere is only 2/ sources ie whole uni, ere is g e fa, n ere se devil, e enemy, who made himself a wicked father. so…when ur mind is vy active, set on hu view o tgs n ur sl lf is vy active, en stn has a way t [represent] his mind in qr mind (i.e. peter). ta is all o us. “We do not allow a woman t tch w/ aut over a m.” No woman wd fnc lk ti, trying t tch w/ aut. ta is true. but none o us has e right jt t innovate st, t tch st. e l showed me ti, so ti was nonnegotiable. wa e l shows u, let e Body prove…you don’t want ta bec u r in dkn. e miy o ti age, o Br. nee n Br. lee, is an accumulative miy o all e great teachers v rcvd f hundreds o yrs. we absorb all. wr indebted t em. so apparently wr getting e spkg o only ti m n ta m. well, Luther is ere, t e extent he sd b, Darby is there…Whatever is rcvd, wr heirs t it…And changing e image t e 12/ foundations oe NJ, ey r layer upon layer. so vl, when e l ndd t make a turn t e rcvd ch, h knew h cd not get tr in America (the religious sys wdnt allow), not in Europe…He went t China. bec im not Chinese, I va standing t make ti stark stm. 1/ r1 y a gd number o American theologians rnt open t rc Br. lee’s miy is ta he ia Chinese. if ere has bn an elite, intellectual caucasian, ere wdt v bn a pb, ie Body it shouldn't mtr tr whom e l is spkg. ey say, “Oh, he is frm China, oriental mysticism.” How au occidental mysticism? y don’t u study it…and how dgd ii. i hate ta. i hate bias lk ti. god hates it. he is no respecter o pes. so u can und y brothers lk Brothers Ed n me r w/u. wv a full confidence ta wa wr presenting tu is frm e miy. but wa we say, et, has t b tested by e [word], wch se aplt. now we come t e es, e content o it.

I ag ta anything mya is…mysterious. but ey rnt synonyms. i am going t share w/u my present undg, wch I admit…is incomplete. mya refers t a rlt, spa rlt ta we cannot contact or sbt by qr senses, qr pha

oe hvl miy ox. n e readg assignment f next week, wch has bn distributed tu, se Life-study o Psalms, wch is 1/ oe highest rvns ox ie OT, n en ie Life-study o Luke, after Br. lee conducted e trng n gave thirty msgs during ta trng, as he often prcd, he was burdened t qv many supplementary msgs. n ere were some on Christ’s miy in hs ascn. n I  bl ii in ti readg assignment u wl come t a crucial mtr ta connects Christ’s hvl miy n qr partq situations n ccms, whatever ey are…One e 1/ hand, x ae hpi is touched w/ e feeling o qr infirmities, h is interceding f us w/o ceasing, h is able t sv us t e uttermost. n h is determined t do ti n wl do ti. so h cares f us w/ profound lv, tenderness, compassion, understanding…but wrnt e center. we pel rnt e center o ti. e l in hs hvl miy is continuing t carry out gz ete prp. n as g, h can take care o all o us in ev situation n listen t us contacting hm at e same time. n as m h is able t sympathize w/ qr situation. but once we begin t ap more n more Christ’s hvl miy, vl wlc ta, yes, e l is shg u ie hvs. he is interceding f u. he is mig e hvl su itu. but h is doing ti acc t g n hs wl, not acc t ur expectations. in other words, wa h does n e way h does it may not b wa u expect. ti doesn’t mean ta in ur prrs u don’t sincerely [ask for] wa is in ur hrt. don’t hold back. whatever u want hm t do, u ask hm t do. ti ia child coming t one’s fa n jt asking. ti is precious. ti sd not cease. at e same time unt rz ta e lz caring o u n ur situation is ie context oe Body, e nm, e kd, e bride. so h is caring f eh 1/ o us specifically. but h is doing ti w/ e view oe ut goal, hs wife, e NJ. so bec o ta, certain prrs ta we offer, e l unds y we wd offer it. but h wlt answer ta prr e way ta is epd. n jt a brief example…in 2/ parts, meaning 2/ asps. many yrs ago, more than 35 yrs ago, we were prg in an English lgg prr mtg in Anaheim. ere was an elder brother critically ill…We didn’t want him t pass away now. we felt he had many more yrs. i remember, as we were prg, 1/ brother prd, “Lord, we know ta You va wl, but we also va ds.” So ti opened e way f us t pr in a two-fold manner. “We va desire…that You wd intervene n stop e pg o ti illness n extend hs lf.” How can we expect anything other than ta. “While wr prg ti, we akl Your lordship, sovereignty…Simultaneously wr honoring ur wl.” This may open e way f u t communicate w/ g e fa in ur situation. recently, a fef brother…advanced in age. b4 we prd, e brothers said, wa was in ti brother’s hrt was t qv him 5/ more yrs t finish e translation…Almost all e sas strongly entered into ta prr. but I cd not enter into ta prr. i didn’t oppose it. but I cdt enter into it bec as smo who has bn serving e l n under hs dln vy much, I va lvg cn f anyone who might b nearing e end oe course. e lz pe is far more imp than qr wk. n so esp as wr drawing t e end t say, “Lord, let me stay here t do ti,” is undb. ta ds sd b epd. we sympathize w/ it. but we still vt remember, wr conversing w/ g, w/ e l. n suppose e l has a df intention. n what’s in my hrt, “Lord, enable ti brother n all o us w/ an outward lv f [You].” “Lord, I wd lk t do more, but I leave ta t You. u r e lv o my lf, my 1/a lv.” So e readg assignment has bn longer than most but iint quite as mysu ae high peak miy so u sd b able t absorb it. read it in 2/ lvls. ie way t get e view oe whole. esp, Psalm 110 n Luke. en as u r readg, jt b opened f e l t impress u w/ a partq mtr.I.Now we come t Psalm 110. n ti psalm is quoted many times ie nt. n is referred t even more times. “Sit at My right hand.” This ia some kind o metaphor. so I ap e brother spkg oe vv, “higher than e hvs.” Heavens refer t a location. but g is higher than e hvs. t b ie hvs is t b ie location. t b ie hvls is t b at ascn. t b at e right hand o g is t b at e highest posn ie uni. but e vv says, “sit at My right hand.” Christ’s ascn is secondarily a mtr o pa, a rlm. ii 1/y a mtr o a pe. ascd t b in a person—God hf. ti somewhat parallels t php 2…God exalted…and gave hm name. so now ere ia m in g. n t hm all aut in hv n on earth is given. matt. 28:18-19. christ as g always had ti aut. now as a m h has ti aut. n h returned t e Gh ae gm. he didn’t put off hs hy. he is at e right hand t execute gz admn. did u notice e emphasis in ti short psalm? e enemies. er enemies still active ie uni. christ dftd em. but e execution is st ta wlb carried out by x tr e ch. n in 1/a Corinthians 15, au ie middle oe chapter we spk o Christ’s posn, n h must rule until all e enemies v bn dftd. ti ia primary activity esp ie age in wch wr living…the rbn, ursn, e lack o justice. so h is executing ti aut in hs hvl miy in hs ascn until all e enemies r subdued. he can put hs feet on em as a footstool. “…Rule ie midst o Your enemies.” So e l intends t uplift e prr miy oe ch corpl t conquer e chaos, t brg e di eco into e chaos n conquer it. so e chaos ain’t going nowhere…But e l wants t rule ie midst o ta chaos. so uva rspe, a voluntary offering ie day o warfare…This se unique work—to b 1/ w/ ti hvl x, t deal w/ hs enemies. so wr lk young men n women. ere is no draft…Let’s say, we declare war, many wl volunteer. so ti ia voluntary offering. ie day o warfare. so ti nds t b thoughtful. ti nds t b cid. ta is y in 1968, I was still in my 20s, when I read e Glorious Church, n read ta chapter on e Work o g, I didn’t v ti vv frm Psalm 110 in mind. but I had a rl transaction w/ e l, “I choose t ptp in ti wk.” It int a crn t live a happy life…church lf in Maui, u go surfing, fishing…now u r on ur way t bcg lukewarm. u jt rz ti is wa is going on b4 e l can return t e earth w/ hs warrior wife, h nds t raise up…among e churches…Young men—spiritually strong believers…they r o army age. n en, “Shatter e kgs, execute jdm among e nations.” To some extent e l nds t do ti. when in rspe t e prr oe brothers cng Russian spkg world, g shattered e Soviet Union. my wife, Tanya…woke up 1/ day and…So ere, e l is vy active in ti. n h wl shatter e hd over e great land utl in Armageddon. in vv 7, “He wl drink e brook btw.” And e brook is in ursp, ta ulb a refreshment t hm. n h wl lift up hs hd bec ere ia hu side t ti. ti psalm is so profound, ii ixh. so v ur 1/a run tr it n jt ej it…II.That is how epe chapter 1 ends. uv x rrd, ascd w/ e fourfold power. e l made hm hoc. now ii pointless f u t inwardly bc cu o wa e l is doing ie hvs rn. e l wl make u aware o ti tr tmn. so wa is bg decided on e thrown by g ix, e som, e l o hv n earth, nds t b carried out on earth. ti ivs e pl o prr. e pl o prr is ta in ti age g is no longer acting unilaterally, ta is, all by hf. he doesn’t say, “I’m g, I think il change e gvm o Iran td n open it up f e white horse oe gospel….” No, n I do bl h wants t open up Iran. i do bl h wants t open up Cuba…North Korea. but h wlt jt do it as g. so h ebd e pl prayer—God wants t do st. but in ti age h wl not do it alone. he nds t agm n coon oe ch, o hs p, so h en tms it, makes it known tr e intuition oe sps oe sas so ta ey v some grasp o wa e l wants t do. n ti se lz ds. en it bcs eir ds. e l wants it, we want it bec all genuine prr has its source, uvt want it…otherwise u forget au it…You can’t help but brg it again n again. “If My words ab in you…ask whatever u wl.” We ab ie l, hs w ab is us, make known hs ds, hs ds bcs qr ds, en we pr t hm, en h flfls hs ds by flflg qr ds, wch se epn in hs ds. he makes it known t us, we pr it back, n en h does it. some brothers had e sense ta e l wanted t open e Russian spkg world. so ey prd diligently, fefl. i don’t know if we wl ever va bsd opp t rc a fp frm Joel Cannon, a fef coworker in Seattle. but ere ia portion ere in ti kind o prr ministry…that wnt lrn from…Otherwise we wl jt vt rely upon e printed miy. so 1/ brother mentioned e pum-pum-pum. ta is where it comes frm, e energy comes frm. here u r in a situation arranged by e l. n so e miy in hv is alert, fully aware o wa u nd, fully cu o wa e wl o g is. sas sw r prg. ere ia mother, a pneumatic mom, sitting on

jt add ti, a kind o P.S…whatever e l rqs oe u, whatever ccms h arranges f u, h wl su u in ta situation. so some ask, Why in ur age u travel so much?…There v bn n wlb an adjustment. but my tty is, whatever e arrangement is, h supplies…this watchful O is fully aware oe situation n ere se tmn into qrsp tr e ch.III.And we read ta in Psalm 110. ere se prfc. n hbs emphasizes ti pih. n e writer, P, is trying t help e jh blrs a radical turn. “You v bn going t e tp, offering up e animal sacrifices, n e high pi acc t e order or aa offers ese t g. all o ta is over. e entire dpn oe OT is over.” Instead o sacrifices, ere is x ae rlt oe offerings…there his e pih acc t e order o mel. so he is calling em out…to continue mtg w/ e ch. so x in hs miy on earth climaxing w/ hs dth, h cmd e aaronic pih. ta se pih brgg e nds o gz p t g n caring f ese nds by offering e sacrifices so ta g cd fg em. so when x was on e cs, h offered hf ae sin offering. in so doing, h was e Priest offering hf ae offering f qr rdn. but en after hs rrn n in hs ascn, h bcm e hpi in another way. e order o mel. now wnt make a quick visit t Genesis 14. abraham fnd out ta Lot n others, eir pzns v bn taken by e enemy…recovered et. en a pe appeared, a mysu pe, named mel. a pi, king o Salem. no 1/ knows where he came frm. he was a pi. n he midd t abm bread n wine. so ti high pi has bn prg. ta is y abm cd b fighting n b victorious. now ti 1/ came t mi bread n wine. wnt trace ta into e gps where e l ebd e table w/ e bread n cup, “Do ti in remembrance o Me until I come.” So mel int e high pi prg f qr rdn. ta has bn acmpd. he is now mig t brg e su, e bread n e wine t us who r on ti earth carrying out hs prp n fighting spa warfare. genesis 14 se 1/a mention oe pi. so ere se pl o 1/a mention ieb. e pl is ta e 1/a mention ebs e pl o ta. so iint offering sacrifices lk aa. ii mel. so ti se ete pih, fv. n x is now ti hpi acc t e order o mel. he is ti Priest in hs dy w/ hs hy. n when ti begins t dawn on us, ti wlb wf su tu, ta on e 1/ hand, we know frm e vvs ta u shared w/ us, h is interceding f us t b svd t e uttermost. n h se hvl Minister, mig e hvl atm n su t us. but e center, acc t e hbs, o hs hvl miy, se hpi acc t e order o mel. ti is mentioned, I say again, Psalm 110, wch se rvn ox in ascn w/ an emphasis on war. so please remember ta mel did not jt come t any 1/ who was a blr ta time. he came t e fighters. n b4 h came t em, h prd f em t enable em t fight n b victorious. so u wl find, in ur pea lf, ch lf. maybe not ti week, but I bl ie near future, ta at e end o a day, or at e end o a certain event—gospel trip…—Melchizedek comes tu. he doesn’t say anything. but h says, “I’ve bn prg all along…let me serve u, let me mi Myself ae pc3g as ur food n wine. e bread wl nourish u. e wine—Psalm 104—makes glad e hu hrt.” h wants t enrich u w/ hs ls. he wants t brg joy t ur hrt, ti wine. ti se mel.IV.I want t preface my comment on ti section w/ ti. christ is in ascn w/ hs gfd rrn bo. n im now jt asserting a feeble thought o Ron Kangas. at e end o Luke n beginning o Acts, e dls r watching hm asc. n Luke 24 says, while h is ascg, h is bsg em. en in Acts ey r watching hm n e cloud appears. n e cloud conveys hm t e right hand o God…I think we sd think st tr as much as we can n we know when t stop. i don’t think ere was some kind o super spaceship going 10 times e speed o

is 1/ throne. n we know frm e miy, e sbj o Revelation, I read it, is x ae center o gz admn acc t gee. so e sbj int locusts. iint a dragon. iint beasts. iint frogs. ii x ae center o gz admn acc t gee. so e x who is on e throne, chapter 5 vv 6, e lb, who is also e Lion, h can open e scroll, ta is, h can execute, carry out, gz admn. but in chapter 1, John sees hm ie midst oe golden lampstand. i know wr familiar…but I wd lk t read it again. vv 13 n following. “And ie midst oe lampstands, 1/ lk e S o Man…shine in its power.” The apl John was e 1/ leaning on e lz breast. vy intimate w/ hm. even Peter motioned t John au a mtr at e final feast. we know frm e gp how profound was his xp. how he was broadened…mature t e uttermost. but ti apl saw e l whom he lvd in a ttly df way. “And when I saw hm, I fell at hs feet as dead.” The l can’t deny wa h is. when h appears in hs admn, h appears as h is. when h comes back, e whole world wl c hm as wa h is—the Sun o righteousness…There has t b at least 1/ time, in qr lf w/ e l, where we fall at hs feet…one w/ aut, carrying out gz admn. n anyone bearing rspy ie ch nds t mt Him…He is coming t adm. n h wl spk t all e chs n knows eal wa ey nd. but h is ere w/ e pil garment, golden girdle, t cherish, t nourish, t su. when u bc aware o a situation ie ch or a pb or a duy or a mistake, don’t overreach ur posn. don’t go online n talk au it. brg it t e Lord…in a sincere prayer…the l wl take care o all hs chs. he wl come n execute hs admn. so we’ve seen ti in qr history…faithful elders did not [lead e sas astray]. e l came into ta situation n allow e fef ones t continue mtg ae ch in Toronto in fp w/ e Body. e rest went into another drn. ti int a hu intervention. but at e same time, h is trimming e golden lampstands. so e wick, ii burned up, so ere ia long, black wick. so h trims it. he puts it into a golden container. n h wl pour a new oil…and ti h wl do ti us. br. lee was 90+, close t 92. he was new, fresh, vital, vigorous, in rrn, all e

u touch e mtr o lv. u touch e mtr oesp. n yet epe ia book on e bdg, on e Body. wa kind o lv is ti? ii lv ta includes everyone—even nonbelievers. iie lv ta includes all e bns, but has no preference. e only preference is t e hh o fe. paul says in php, let lv b w/ all discernment. ti means ta qr lv int naa, iint blind. we nd e discernment. wa happens if I v lv but I do not v discernment? if wr in a vital gr, if wv a vital group—well, wv a vital partner, en et passes tr ta fp. “Should I go t visit my relatives?” Should I do ti, go ere? we nd e Body. we nd e prrs. we nd e intercessions. we nd e

n tor prr indl n corpl. n much n tor fp. en we get e su oe Body. ti lz day I had some burden. n 2/ oe brothers were encg t share st. but 1/ oe brothers haven’t said anything. so ie middle oe mtg I fpd w/ em, “How do u feel?” This ia mtg oe ch. i can’t jt say whatever I want t say. i fpd some tgs, some feeling. he felt gd. en I felt rlsd. i had no fm t share anything until I knew ta he wd b happy.

brother has a feeling, we jt say, “Amen.” Whether we do it or not depends on more fp. but we can at least ag. “Preach e gp?” Amen! ch nds t preach e gp. qr small gr nds t preach e gp. qr vital gr, qr cmps, wnt preach e gp. well, so u might nd t do a lot o tgs. o course uv ur assignment. n may e l breakthrough in ev assignment. but it takes a lot o fp t find e lz mind. “Be oe same mind toward ona.” That is muy. “Not setting e mind on e high tgs. but going along w/ e lowly.” Somebody has a crazy idea but iint heretical. ey feel t do it. wa is wrong? do not b wise in yourselves. e s may b in ta, t help em lrn how t fp instead o jt giving eir opi. how do ey lrn t b in 1/ Body if u can’t b in 1/ Body w/ em?Then in chapter 13 vv 8, “Hold nothing t anyone except t lv ona.” O another. paul was a “one another” pe. he had no pce in his sp until he fnd Titus, his brother, so ta he cd find out wa was happening in Corinth. completely ie sense, e feeling, e burden, f e chs, f e sas; ona. ur vital

it may b pea. it may b a mtr related t e ch. it may b all kinds o tgs. but u r jt w/ 1/ mind, 1/ sl, moving forward. n maybe ta is enough. if u look at Romans, ere ia lot o 1/ another’s ones u get t chapter 12.Then ie chapter on riches, I think I covered ta pnt. en ti mtr o df ways ta we can rc guidances frm g. here he mentions e bb, e HS. sometimes we even mention e env. but wa au e Body? christ

oe ch.” O oe brothers were fpg w/ me au ti stm, “Often a decision in rural area proves t b better than a decision frm a ch ie city…it does not arrive from…but…corporate skg.” Corporate skg means eo

wlb o help. “It is regrettable t v elders…without cun ta ey nd coorn in order t b cpb in et.” Can u b cpb in et? “It int enough f an elder t b cpb in 1/ area or part only. elders vt b cpb in et.” How do we mt ev nd? “Surely, many times ey feel ey cannot mt e many nds oe ch. er many tgs ta we sd c ta we haven’t c, sd think o ta we sd v thought of…have guarded against…have br up.” It is an impossible job. jt think au shg 1/ other pe. how many tgs we don’t think au. we forget t look st up. how t help em. fp au how t help em. pr w/ smo. intercede. “Many tgs we sd v said but v not said. frm qr xp, wv fnd out ta e elders vt b cpb in et yet in many areas wv fallen short. f ti r1, wvt c ta e elders must b coord.” Today, we may use e w ‘blended.’ “Because 1/ mb cannot b cpb in et. only e Body is cpb in et.” Just t qvu n illustration. in Fullerton we had a corp lz table. n it wasn’t ta ere was a bad feeling. but ere was jt lk a, maybe a—not a wet blanket, but—wet sheet over e mtg. jt st wasn’t right. i sensed ta n fpd w/ another brother ie eldership. he had e same feeling. but we didn’t know wa it was. so we br e mtr. u might say, “What mtr?” Our feelings. t e brothers. n ey all

e “walking” is ai term, touching ev area o qr lf. n P says, “Walk by e s.” Not jt “pray by e s, read e w by e s.” You all ej singing ie meetings…that is wf. but as soon as u walk out o mtg pa, u interact w/ df ones…Your emotion got stirred up. st not so pleasant happened t you…You feel bad, “I sdnt act ta way, im a xn, im a trne!” So u repent back t e l, “Help me g, f me t behave more lk a trne.” Then u pr ur religious prrs. ti is au as far as most gd xns r. o course some cd care less n continue t live e way ey do. but many better xns, ey feel bad…repented. but wa is ti? is ti walking by e s? in a recent conf, I mentioned e 7/ layers o tomb ta wr buried under, ta hinders us frm living out, frm carrying out ge in qr daily lf. u still remember? 1) The fall o m. m has bc fallen. m was not only created. bec stn came in, e serpent came in, seduced m, m bcm fallen. ere ia fallen na in m ta is sinful. ta is called sin. 2) Natural lf. along w/ ti fallen na, ere se naa bg. god does not want anything naa. after m was created, g want[ed] m t pt oe tree o lf. m nds t read another lf n b rgd by another life…But m not only bcm fallen but has a naa lf. ti is wa we have…by birth. 3) Culture(?) 4) Religion. ti ia big area. in last 6000 years…Every hu bg v some religious na in em. even e atheists. ey ve atheistic religion. ey denounce e xsc o g. but ta is also a kind o religion. ere is an inclination in m, wanting t gd, t honor ti supreme bg. ere ia religious na in m. 5) Ethics. who does not lk ethics? we all ap ethics. e whole Confucius tchg is built on ethical tchgs, helping p t b gd. e other day I took a über, talking t e driver if he had ever heard au JX. he said, “As long as I want t b good…that is gd enough.” They jt want t b ethical, t b kind, t b ppr, n so forth. en uv another layer, ta is 6) qr virs. as far as virs, ii st relative. wa 1/ views as a vir may not b ci by another as a vir (e.g. quickness)…But some say, “No, t b slow ia vir.”…Anyhow, e fact is ta not only wv ethical thinking, but also wv view o virs. en lastly, e 7/a layer. i wd say t ti some may va duy t und. 7) Our spa pursuit, qr spa skg. ta is probably e most du 1/ t oc. what’s wrong w/ bg spa?

or do u live by e s? so, ti s se vy cmn oe p3g. he is living in us. n qr dsp nd td is f us t live n walk by ti s acc t ti s both ie mtgs, outside oe mtgs. ti is wa wnt build…up. y do you…prophesy ti way? bec e s leads u. y r u going t serve, going t job, going t Boston? bec e s leads you…And none o us sd do st bec, “That pa nds me. ta pa asked me t go. e elders want me t serve.” Does e s want u t serve?…Well, uvt lrn t follow e s. sometimes ere ia conflict…Then u don’t jt rb aga e elders n say, “I am following e s, I don’t care wa u say.” Those brothers, ey also ve s. wvt fp. wvt lrn t follow e s, t fp, so ta tr e fp, e Spirit’s mind can b br forth. instead o jt readily going t react t certain response…to turn away frm a situation n use ursp ae excuse. no, e s is always 1/ w/ e Body. e Body is also always full oe Spirit…At e same time wnt also know qrsp. live n walk by e s.Another tg ta is related t this…is e mtr o bg cff. e conformity…Gal. 4:19. christ formed in u. wa is t v smo formed in us?

y did h say ti? god is s. ti ia fundamental th. how can g, who is s, v blood? only created animals n hu bgs v blood. nevertheless P says ti. so wnt trace e thought ie nt t arrive at an accurate undg o y he says gz blood n how ti is going t b a primary mtr in qr daily lf w/ e l n dft e enemy who accuses e brothers day n night, ii constant. e ocrs oc by e blood. ta se 1/a item. ey know how t appp it, ey v fe in it, ey know it sfs gz rqms, ey know ta it dfts e enemy, ta it pus cnc. e gk w translated, “obtained,” also means acquired, or purchased. let’s say I had a certain wk o art n ta I went t ti auction ey v in London n I paid $810 mil. 1/a o all u wd want t c e obj. but u wd b more cnd o y I wd pay ta much o money?

bec et ivd w/ e m dying is temporal n spacial, ere is no ete efficacy t any created tg. n ere must b an ulmd, ete efficacy if wr t appp it thousands, mils, vl, o blrs, aba t b qr rlt. wa se means by wch we do ti? so as a m h had genuine hu blood. n as g h has e ele ta gives hs blood ete efficacy. ti brings us t a central vv 1 John 1:7. “But if we walk ie lt as h [God] is ie lt, wv fp w/ ona n e blood o j, hs S, czs us frm ev sin.” John, who wrote e Gospel oe God-Savior, who had a profound, deep xp n kl o g, h wrote in ti way. not jt “the blood o j,” only but, “the blood o j, gz S.” The blood n e efficacy oe blood r combined. now, in a way I do not want t adjust n certainly not correct e way u r praying…“Lord we appp Your blood.” There is nothing wrong w/ ta. please don’t cease prg ta. but wrnt rqd t do ta bec st is happening spul. if wr ie lt, eref whatever g wants t expose n ifu, h can do it. so qr walking is ie lt, qr living is ie lt, now wr vg fp w/ ona. now wr vg ta fp, e blood o j, gz S, is continually czg us frm ev sin. wh u ask f it or not…cleanses us frm ev sin. ti may sound unnecessary, but f penetration n f ctn, iint. e vv does not say, “most sins.” Doesn’t say, “sins u cnf,” “sins u remember.” It says, “every sin.” Now we know ta in vv 9…we r cnfg ta g pnts out t us bec ti partq mtr is hindering fp. so we cnf. n e gk w f cnf is ‘homo-legeo.’ It means t spk e same tg. same tgs as wa?
